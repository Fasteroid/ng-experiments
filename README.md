# ng-experiments
<br/>

A collection of random shit I wanted to learn about
<br/>
<br/>

## Setting up (please read)

This monorepo provides each experiment the same installation of Angular 16 to share.  
Additional dependencies are left to each experiment to manage separately.

This means you may need to `npm install` twiceâ€”once in the root of this repo, and **again** in the root of *&lt;insert experiment here&gt;*  

## Testing

- Navigate to an experiment and run `ng serve` for a dev server
- Navigate to an experiment and run `ng test` to execute its unit tests if any exist
